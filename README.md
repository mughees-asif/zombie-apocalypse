## Introduction

* This mini-game was built as a project for the Interactive Agents and Procedural Generation (ECS7016P) module at Queen Mary, University of London.
* The aim of the game is to complete the maximum number of levels without the health reaching 0.
* Food items can be collected to replenish the health.
* The interaction of the player with the enemy or the boundary walls of the game result in a reduction in the health of the player.
