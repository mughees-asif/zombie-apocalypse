## Introduction

* This mini-game was built as a project for the Interactive Agents and Procedural Generation (ECS7016P) module at Queen Mary, University of London.
* The aim of the game is to complete the maximum number of levels without the health reaching 0.
* Food items can be collected to replenish the health.
* The interaction of the player with the enemy or the boundary walls of the game result in a reduction in the health of the player.

### Setup

* This project was developed on Unity version `2020.3.32f1`.
* Drag and drop the `TechDemo.unity` scene into the `Hierarchy` window.
* The dependencies will be loaded and the scene can be run.

## Procedural Generation

### Level generation

* The levels are generated on an `8 x 8` board consisting of different texture tiles located in the `ğŸ“‚Prefabs` folder.

* The levels are procedurally generated using [Cellular Automation](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/CellularAutomaton.html) until the player dies i.e., runs out of health.

* When the player's health reaches zero, the game ends.

### Food generation

* The food regenerates the player's health by 20 points per each item. 
* The placement of the food items is randomised within the game environment.

## Interactive Agents

#### Player

#### Enemies

* The sprites, prefabs, and animations were imported from the [2D Roguelike package](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/tutorials/2d-roguelike-29825).

## Suggested Improvements

* The movement of the zombies
* Character animations
